# TODO: figure out why did i disable the "mirrored" option even though it's better, 100% forgot
# Reason 1: it causes VPN ip not tunneled properly lol, need to use OVPN 2.47 
## -> https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/10879
# Reason 2: also causing freaking docker port publish not working, update docker to 27.x and enable hostAddressLoopback
