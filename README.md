Perhaps can only be applied to WSL Ubuntu (or Unix in General) and macOS

For WSL Installation refer to: [WSL Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

For Terminal

- Use this one for Windows: [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/)
- Alacritty also works: [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
- Ghostty is preferred on macOS: [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)

## How to run

1. Run the script according to your OS -> might change in the future but this will do for now

- `run-linux.sh` for linux
- `run-macos.sh` for macOS

2. **(OPTIONAL)** You can modify the playbook accordingly. Example: you might want to commented out the `tasks/git-setup.yml` because it contain my personal Github information

3. Grab a Coffee ☕️, since it's gonna take a while. Cheers!!!
